    "This heuristic-based code provides a solution for matching students into groups based on their preferences and skill levels for team formation. It includes the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A Student class to store student information such as user ID, name, current group size, desired group size, skill levels, availability, and timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A match_students function that takes a list of students and the maximum group size as input. It iterates through the students, finds potential matches based on \n",
    "   skill level compatibility and availability, and forms complete or incomplete groups accordingly. \n",
    "   The function also handles unassigned students and attempts to add them to incomplete groups at different availability thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Helper functions:\n",
    "   - find_potential_matches: Finds potential matches for a student based on skill level compatibility, availability, and group size constraints.\n",
    "   - find_potential_additions: Finds potential additions to an existing group based on skill level compatibility, availability, and group size constraints.\n",
    "   - create_group: Creates a string representation of a group, including group members, average skill level, and common availability.\n",
    "   - calculate_average_skill_level: Calculates the average skill level when combining two students' groups.\n",
    "   - calculate_average_skill_level_group: Calculates the average skill level for a group of students.\n",
    "   - check_availability: Checks if two students have at least two common availability slots.\n",
    "   - check_availability_group: Checks if a group meets the availability threshold based on the minimum required common availability slots.\n",
    "   - find_common_availability: Finds the common availability slots for a group of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code also includes a sample dataset of 15 students with various attributes for testing purposes.\n",
    "You can load the actual data collected from users and apply this approach and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "1. Import the Student class and the match_students function.\n",
    "2. Create a list of Student objects with the required attributes.\n",
    "3. Call the match_students function with the list of students and the desired maximum group size.\n",
    "4. The function returns three lists: formed_groups (complete groups), incomplete_groups (partially formed groups), and unassigned_users (students who could not be matched).\n",
    "5. Process the returned lists according to your application's requirements.\n",
